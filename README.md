### Advance Topics in Computer Vision (Course Plan)

#### **Course Overview**

This course is uniquely designed to cover a range of computer vision techniques. The emphasis will be on the foundational knowledge in image processing, machine learning, and deep learning for vision tasks. There will be enough practical skills that will be imparted through quizzes, assignments, and a research project culminating in a small product.

### **Course Topics**

#### **Foundations of Image Processing**

1. **Image Representation:** The basic structure of digital images (pixels, color spaces, formats) is fundamental to all computer vision tasks.

2. **Image as a Function:** Images are mathematical functions that enable transformation and manipulation, thus essential for preprocessing tasks.

3. **Geometric Transformations**  foundational operations (translation, rotation, scaling) for image alignment and manipulation.

4. **Feature Extraction** Keypoint detection and feature descriptors are critical for object recognition and tracking.

5. **Filtering (1D and 2D)**  convolution and kernel-based filtering techniques for smoothing and edge detection.

#### **Mathematical Foundations**

6. **Fourier Transform** Frequency domain analysis aids in filtering, noise reduction, and image compression.

7. **Probability and Statistics in Vision**  probabilistic methods for segmentation, recognition, and denoising.

#### **Classical Computer Vision Techniques**

8. **Feature Matching and Comparison**  similarity metrics and matching techniques for image registration and stitching.

9. **Epipolar Geometry** Essential for understanding 3D vision tasks like stereo vision and camera calibration.

10. **RANSAC**  robust model estimation for tasks like homography and fundamental matrix computation.

11. **Camera Models and Calibration**  intrinsic/extrinsic camera parameters and their role in accurate image capture.

12. **Stereo Vision** Depth estimation techniques form the basis for 3D reconstruction and AR applications.

#### **Machine Learning for Vision**

13. **Neural Networks (NN)**  perceptrons and activation functions, forming the basis of deep learning models.

17. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  convolution layers and pooling, foundational to modern vision systems.

18. **ResNet**  residual learning, solving the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.

19. **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**  real-time object detection, widely used in industry.

20. **U-Net**  semantic segmentation, critical for medical imaging and other applications.

#### **Generative Models and Modern Techniques**

21. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**  generative modeling for tasks like image synthesis and enhancement.

22. **Diffusion Models**  a modern approach to generative modeling, rivaling GANs.

23. **Latent Diffusion Models**  advanced generative modeling techniques for high-quality synthesis.

24. **Transformers**  self-attention mechanisms and their applications in sequence modeling.

25. **Vision Transformers (ViT)**  transformer models to vision tasks, demonstrating their versatility.

26. **CLIP**  multimodal learning with vision and text embeddings, enabling zero-shot classification.

27. **Explainability in Vision**  interpretability methods like Grad-CAM, essential for trust in AI systems.
