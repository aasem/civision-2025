### Advanced Topics in Computer Vision (Course Plan)

#### **Course Overview**

This course is uniquely designed to cover a range of computer vision techniques. The emphasis will be on the foundational knowledge in image processing, machine learning, and deep learning for vision tasks. There will be enough practical skills that will be imparted through quizzes, assignments, and a research project culminating in a small product.

### **Course Topics**

#### **Classical Foundations**

1. **Image Representation:** The basic structure of digital images (pixels, color spaces, formats) is fundamental to all computer vision tasks.

2. **Image as a Function:** Images are mathematical functions that enable transformation and manipulation, thus essential for preprocessing tasks.

3. **Geometric Transformations**  foundational operations (translation, rotation, scaling) for image alignment and manipulation.

4. **Feature Extraction** Keypoint detection and feature descriptors are critical for object recognition and tracking.

5. **Filtering (1D and 2D)**  convolution and kernel-based filtering techniques for smoothing and edge detection.

6. **Fourier Transform** Frequency domain analysis aids in filtering, noise reduction, and image compression.

7. **Probability and Statistics in Vision**  probabilistic methods for segmentation, recognition, and denoising.

#### **Modern Computer Vision**

8. **Neural Networks (NN)**  perceptrons and activation functions, forming the basis of deep learning models.

9. **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)** Builds on neural networks to explore deeper architectures for classification and regression.

10. **Nearest Neighbour Classification**

11. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** Classical machine learning method still relevant for many vision tasks like classification.

12. **AutoEncoders**  encoding/decoding methods for compression, denoising, and feature learning.

13. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  convolution layers and pooling, foundational to modern vision systems.

14. **ResNet**  residual learning, solving the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.

15. **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**  real-time object detection, widely used in industry.

16. **U-Net**  semantic segmentation, critical for medical imaging and other applications.

#### **Cutting Edge**

17. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**  generative modeling for tasks like image synthesis and enhancement.

18. **Diffusion Models**  a modern approach to generative modeling, rivaling GANs.

19. **Latent Diffusion Models**  advanced generative modeling techniques for high-quality synthesis.

20. **Transformers**  self-attention mechanisms and their applications in sequence modeling.

21. **Vision Transformers (ViT)**  transformer models to vision tasks, demonstrating their versatility.

22. **CLIP**  multimodal learning with vision and text embeddings, enabling zero-shot classification.

23. **Explainability in Vision**  interpretability methods like Grad-CAM, essential for trust in AI systems.
